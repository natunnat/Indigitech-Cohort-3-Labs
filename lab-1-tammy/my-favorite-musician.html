    <h1>Remembering Sinead O'Connor</h1>

    <!-- a bit about Sinead O'Connor's influence on me -->
    <p>
      Personally, I do not really have a favorite musician, however, there are definitely a handful of musicians that had great influence over me in my teenaage years, that I still believe are remarkable musicians, with Sinead O'Connor at the top of my list.  She is definitely one of my most respected musicians and her untimely death left a big hole in my heart. </p>
      <p>I was introduced to her powerful soprano voice in the early 90's, which was when she was at the peak of her career, or rather it was the peak of her career in the American Music Industry, which never treated the woman with any sorts of respect, and attempted to change her look, which was a definite no-go for O'Connor. I remember watching that infamous episode of Saturday Night Live way back in 1992 when she appeared as their musical guest.  Instead of singing one of her hits, such as Prince's "Nothing Compares 2U", O'Connor chose to take advantage of her spotlight and used the opportunity as a chance for her to publically protest against the Catholic church's sexual abuse of children. She performmed an a capella rendition of Bob Marley's 1976 song "War", then held a photograph of Pope John Paul II up to the camera, tore it to pieces, said "fight the real enemy", and threw the pieces to the floor.  There was no applause, only the piercing silence of a live audience in total shock of what they just witnessed. From this moment,I very much admired Sinead for her all of her activism throughout the years, and of course for her refusal to bow down to the American music industry labels, by mantaining her shaved head and her alternative style. </p>

<!-- Sinead throughout my adult years -->
        <p>As I continued my life as an adult, doing all of my adult things, like working, becoming a mom, and moving from apartment to apartment, pretty much growing as us humans do, Sinead O'Connor also continued on with her life.  I can't say that I ever paid too much attention, however, I always did enjoy when an article in the news would pop up out of the blue, or I would always get excited if suddenly I heard her music being played.  What can I say, she made a lasting impression on me.  To be honest, when I had my first ipod and discovered itunes, and all that was available, I did manage to download each and every one of her albums.  I just had to. 
             I was quite saddenned when Sinead started to publically speak about her suicidal tendancies, her battles with bi-bolar depression and PTSD.  It was evident that she had yet to find the help she truly needed in order to live a peaceful and happy life. </p>
<!--The passing  -->
      </p>Sadly, Sinead O'Connor passed away in July 2023 at the young age of 56. It was pretty much instinctive to assume that se took her own life, as she had recently been displaying so much emotional pain and had already came close to death at her own hands.  One year following her passing, it was finally made public that Sinead O'Connor did not die of suicide, nor did she die with all kinds of drugs in her system.  Sadly, yet almost gratefully, she passed away from natural causes at a far too young age of 56.  My reference to grattitude is simply because I felt better knowing that it was not suicide or an overdose.
