    <!-- a bit about Sinead O'Connor's influence on me -->
    <p>
      Personally, I do not really have a favorite musician, however, there are definitely a handful of musicians that had great influence over me in my teenaage years, that I still believe are remarkable musicians, with Sinead O'Connor at the top of my list.  She is definitely one of my most respected musicians and her untimely death left a big hole in my heart. </p>
      <p>I was introduced to her powerful soprano voice in the early 90's, which was when she was at the peak of her career, or rather it was the peak of her career in the American Music Industry, which never treated the woman with any sorts of respect, and attempted to change her look, which was a definite no-go for O'Connor. I remember watching that infamous episode of Saturday Night Live way back in 1992 when she appeared as their musical guest.  Instead of singing one of her hits, such as Prince's "Nothing Compares 2U", O'Connor chose to take advantage of her spotlight and used the opportunity as a chance for her to publically protest against the Catholic church's sexual abuse of children. She performmed an a capella rendition of Bob Marley's 1976 song "War", then held a photograph of Pope John Paul II up to the camera, tore it to pieces, said "fight the real enemy", and threw the pieces to the floor.  There was no applause, only the piercing silence of a live audience in total shock of what they just witnessed. From this moment,I very much admired Sinead for her all of her activism throughout the years, and of course for her refusal to bow down to the American music industry labels, by mantaining her shaved head and her alternative style. </p>

<!-- Sinead throughout my adult years -->
        <p>As I continued my life as an adult, doing all of my adult things, like working, becoming a mom, and moving from apartment to apartment, pretty much growing as us humans do, Sinead O'Connor also continued on with her life.  I can't say that I ever paid too much attention, however, I always did enjoy when an article in the news would pop up out of the blue, or I would always get excited if suddenly I heard her music being played.  What can I say, she made a lasting impression on me.  To be honest, when I had my first ipod and discovered itunes, and all that was available, I did manage to download each and every one of her albums.  I just had to. 
             I was quite saddenned when Sinead started to publically speak about her suicidal tendancies, her battles with bi-bolar depression and PTSD.  It was evident that she had yet to find the help she truly needed in order to live a peaceful and happy life. </p>
<!--The passing  -->
      </p>Sadly, Sinead O'Connor passed away in July 2023 at the young age of 56. It was pretty much instinctive to assume that se took her own life, as she had recently been displaying so much emotional pain and had already came close to death at her own hands.  One year following her passing, it was finally made public that Sinead O'Connor did not die of suicide, nor did she die with all kinds of drugs in her system.  Sadly, yet almost gratefully, she passed away from natural causes at a far too young age of 56.  My reference to grattitude is simply because I felt better knowing that it was not suicide or an overdose.

      <h2>More About Sinead O'Connor</h2>
<p>Sinead O'Connor was an Irish singer-songwriter who was not afraid of controversy. She had a very traumatizing childhood growing up by receiving extreme abuse at the hands of her mother. Before finishing school, O’Connor ran away to Dublin, where she sang and played guitar on the street and in pubs and worked for a singing telegram service. She went on to being nominated for eight Grammy nominations, securing a win in 1991 for Best Alternative Album with "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got". </p>
<p>
  Sinead O'Connor had very messy private life, filled with more than  few failed marriages and brutal custody battles for her four children.
  In April 1999, she was ordained as the first-ever priestess of the Latin Tridentine Church, a dissident Catholic group led by a self-styled Roman Catholic bishop from Ireland named Michael Cox. In April 2000, Mother Bernadette Marie—O'Connor's clerical name—was elevated to Archdeacon for her work with Dublin's homeless.</p>
<p>In 2000, O'Connor signed with Atlantic Records. Her first album in six years, Faith & Courage, was released later that year. She went on to release an album of traditional Irish music, Sean-Nós Nua, in 2002.</p>
<p>O'Connor announced that she was retiring from music in 2003. She Who Dwells in the Secret Place of the Most High Shall Abide Under the Shadow of the Almighty (2003) was supposed to be her last album. According to People magazine, O'Connor posted this message on her website: “I am a very shy person, believe it or not. So I ask with love, that I be left in peace and privacy by people who love my records too.”</p>
<p>In late 2015, O'Connor experienced some type of mental health crisis. She wrote two notes indicating that she was suicidal on her Facebook page before her family requested that the page be taken down. O'Connor was reportedly hospitalized after her first Facebook post.</p>
  <p>In May 2016, O'Connor went missing for a day while biking in Chicago, only to be found by authorities soon after. She then proceeded to write about her personal struggles again on Facebook, this time with a scathing attack on her family, blaming them for her mental health crisis.</p>
    <p>In 2018, O'Connor converted to Islam and changed her name to Shuhada' Sadaqat.</p>
    <p>O'Connor experienced a personal tragedy four years later in January 2022 when her son Shane, then age 17, died by suicide.</p>

She was dropped by her label after selling 7 million albums for them. She became crazed, yes, but uninteresting, never. She had done nothing wrong. She had proud vulnerability … and there is a certain music industry hatred for singers who don't 'fit in' (this I know only too well), and they are never praised until death - when, finally, they can't answer back. The cruel playpen of fame gushes with praise for Sinead today … with the usual moronic labels of “icon” and “legend”. You praise her now ONLY because it is too late. You hadn't the guts to support her when she was alive and she was looking for you. The press will label artists as pests because of what they withhold … and they would call Sinead sad, fat, shocking, insane … oh but not today! Music CEOs who had put on their most charming smile as they refused her for their roster are queuing-up to call her a “feminist icon”, and 15 minute celebrities and goblins from hell and record labels of artificially aroused diversity are squeezing onto Twitter to twitter their jibber-jabber … when it was YOU who talked Sinead into giving up … because she refused to be labelled, and she was degraded, as those few who move the world are always degraded. Why is ANYBODY surprised that Sinead O'Connor is dead? Who cared enough to save Judy Garland, Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse, Marilyn Monroe, Billie Holiday? Where do you go when death can be the best outcome? Was this music madness worth Sinead's life? No, it wasn't. She was a challenge, and she couldn't be boxed-up, and she had the courage to speak when everyone else stayed safely silent. She was harassed simply for being herself. Her eyes finally closed in search of a soul she could call her own. As always, the lamestreamers miss the ringing point, and with locked jaws they return to the insultingly stupid “icon” and “legend” when last week words far more cruel and dismissive would have done. Tomorrow the fawning fops flip back to their online shitposts and their cosy Cancer Culture and their moral superiority and their obituaries of parroted vomit … all of which will catch you lying on days like today … when Sinead doesn't need your sterile slop.”<br>
