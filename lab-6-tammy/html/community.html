              Combining British propriety with an unabashed love for the
              unexpected, London's 3-time Impresario Award-winning duo steep an
              outrageously funny and brilliantly inventive show reminiscent of
              classic British pantos. Rich in wordplay, comic physicality, and
              cleverly crafted interactive elements, O Christmas Tea is
              uproarious fun, yet it is the duo's boundless imagination and
              endearing chemistry that provide the real magic and heart of this
              play. When catastrophe strikes at James and Jamesy's Christmas tea
              party, flooding the world with tea, the duo conjure wildly funny
              solutions to stay afloat, and sweep the audience out to sea in a
              jolly aquatic escapade brimming with whimsy, action, and ingenuity
              in a celebration of friendship at Christmas.

              All are invited to attend the Remembrance Day Service to honour
              and remember Canada's Veterans. The Royal Canadian Legion is
              committed to ensuring Canadians never forget. In today's
              fast-paced world, it can be easy to take our way of life for
              granted, and forget what so many men and women sacrificed for our
              freedoms. Remembrance initiatives remind us to take time to honour
              those who have dedicated their lives to serve our nation.
